      &lt;B&gt;This driver is available in the &lt;A href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ghostscript-printer-app&quot;&gt;Ghostscript Printer Application&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;

      Under this entry Ricoh's PPD files for their Infotec-branded
      PDF printers are hosted. PDF printers are
      supported natively in Linux and Unix environments (including Chrome OS), so you only
      need the PPD file for your printer, no driver executables, to
      get access to all printing functionality. The PPD contains all
      information about properties and user-settable options which are
      specific to the printer and makes printing dialogs show these
      options and allow the user to control all the printer's
      functionality.&lt;p&gt;

      These PPDs are especially made for use on Linux/Unix
      systems. Especially they support all advanced printer features
      like Locked Print, Ducument Server, User Code, ...&lt;p&gt;
