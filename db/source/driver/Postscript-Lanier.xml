      &lt;B&gt;All PPD files of this driver entry are available in the &lt;A href=&quot;https://github.com/OpenPrinting/ps-printer-app&quot;&gt;PostScript Printer Application&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://snapcraft.io/ps-printer-app/embedded?button=black&amp;summary=true&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;300px&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #CCC; border-radius: 2px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      This PPD file based on Postscript is made for Linux/UNIX environment.
      PostScript printers are natively supported in Linux and UNIX environments (including Chrome OS),
      so you only need this PPD file for your printer, no driver executables,
      to get access to all printing functionality.
      Especially this PPD file supports some advanced printer features like Locked Print, Document Server,
      User Codeâ€¦ Note that although the printers are PostScript printers this PPD file needs foomatic-rip.
      Please see the &lt;a
      href=&quot;http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/Database/RicohFAQ&quot;&gt;Ricoh
      FAQs&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;p&gt;

      Note that these printers work, like all other PostScript
      printers, with &lt;a
      href=&quot;show_driver.cgi?driver=Postscript&quot;&gt;generic PostScript
      PPD files&lt;/a&gt;, but then you will not get access to all the
      printer-specific functionality.&lt;p&gt;
